                <p>The old cliché of needing to be muscular like Popeye to be part of a crew or sail is a thing of the past. Sailing has no age barrier. You can sail all your life at all levels, fast or slow, cruising or racing. Sailing is also a wonderful activity to do both solo or alongside the entire family. If you have the chance to do so, you should absolutely learn how to sail. Here are some of the positive reasons learning to sail is a great investment.</p>
